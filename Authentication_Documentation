Authentication

# For ember, there is https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth
which is a general framework, and you need some authentication methods implemented on top of it.

There are two authenticator methods already out there.
* to work with devise (somehow modified to support tokens). THis one adds email and token to each request. It does not appear to refresh or do anything fancy with the token.
https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth/tree/master/packages/ember-simple-auth-devise
* Another one is the below
https://github.com/jpadilla/ember-cli-simple-auth-token
which can also refresh the tokens automatically (meaning, it will request a new token every X minutes). This means using ruby-jwt; which requires a little bit of manual work to integrate with Devise. It also sends the password as part of the token for each and every request.
See following links for ruby-jwt:

Also, there is this very good back-end gem extension to Devise: 
https://github.com/lynndylanhurley/devise_token_auth
which refreshes tokens on each request (although this can be turned off). 
It's not clear which front-end can work with this one; as the ember-simple-auth devise authenticator does not send login in the correct format. 

Back-end, there also is 
https://github.com/gonzalo-bulnes/simple_token_authentication 
well there are a number of commits, I do not trust the security. 
Tokens are fixed once forever. 

So, we are left using tiddle gem, which generates one token per session (and users may have multiple sessions).
Note that tokens do not expire unfortunately, we need to automatically call clean ups.

Improvement on tiddle would be to have token refreshes (and expiry). We'll leave that to v2!
